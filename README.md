# stock-comparer

StockComparer graphically represents daily closing prices for an individual stock or allows for comparing that same stock to different market indexes.  It also allows the user to search for stock symbols (because few of us outside Wall Street know ticker symbols off the top of our heads).  I originally wrote this program in Python for a class project.  I rewrote it in Java for the practice and to take advantage of its GUI library.   The NYSE dataset is limited to six months due to memory issues when packaging it in a jar file.  The app takes a few seconds to load so be patient.
